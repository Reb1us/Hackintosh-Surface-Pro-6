So first of all, i have made this efi specially only for surface pro 4,5,6. 
I did tested this efi only in my surface pro 6 but am sure this will also work for other surface as well.
So what u need now to get hackintosh in ur surface pro is get the macos dmg file from this link https://mirrors.dtops.cc/iso/MacOS/daliansky_macos/
i suggest u to try first macos catalina, btw i tested macos catalina 10.15.6,10.15.7 and macos big sur 11.2. and efi is working without any errors.
After downloading the dmg file of mac that u want, now download this software in ur windows https://www.diskgenius.com/download.php
After software installed, u also need to download the efi from the link given above.
now install balena etcher from this link https://www.balena.io/etcher/
okay now plug in ur usb, at least 16gb of usb is needed, plug the usb and format it.
now open the balena etcher and select the macos dmg file u just downloaded and then select ur usb. [make sure ur usb is formatted]
and click start flash.
after flash is completed, open the disk genius
and in disk genius, select ur usb partition and delete the default efi of ur usb which made automatically. and place my EFI which is given from the link.
now after placing my efi folder in ur usb boot partition its time to boot.
boot in ur surface uefi and then and disable the secureboot and deselect all options except USB Storage.
now click restart and ur usb will boot and after booted in macos installation then ur done, just install the mac and enjoy.
